When we execute the operations in the array for each case we obtain:

1.- {}+{}  ------->  [object Object][object Object]
2.- {}+[]  ------->  [object Object]
3.- []+{}  ------->  [object Object]
4.- []+[]  ------->  

It means that the result that we are obtaining its string representation,
so for the case of [] it string representation is an empty string,
ans so

4.- []+[]  -------> 

is the "sum" of those empty strings
