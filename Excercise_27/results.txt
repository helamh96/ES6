When we execute the operations in the array for each case we obtain:

1.- {}+{}  ------->  [object Object][object Object]
2.- {}+[]  ------->  [object Object]
3.- []+{}  ------->  [object Object]
4.- []+[]  ------->  

It means that the result that we are obtaining is an Object (the datatype),
I would spect it to return something like

4.- []+[]  -------> [object Array][object Array] 

but for some reason the REPL doesn't show anything.
