the function foo1 is creating a new function inside 
wich will console.log this.foo when is called but
it is never called and just return { foo:'bar' }

the function foo2 is doing the same, but it is returning
{ foo: 'baz' }

so when we run the program the only thing that we will see 
is:

{ foo:'bar' }
{ foo: 'baz' }.

even if we run fn() imediately after declare it, it will just 
print undefined.
